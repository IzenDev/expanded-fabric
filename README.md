## • Performance Issues:
Playing such a large modpack can come with some performance issues, so related to the following:

### • Chunks are slowly loading, or not loading at all.
> If this occurs, try increasing the "Chunk Update Threads" option in settings. 
> - If chunks around you are not loading at all, you may want to reload them. You can do this by pressing the following buttons: **F3+A**

### • My FPS is Dropping.
> FPS Dropping can be a varity of things, from having too many block updates in one chunk, too many entites, or your graphics settings are too high. If you experience FPS drops, try this:
> - Turn your "Entity Render Distance" to 125%
> - Change "Graphics" from Fancy to Fast
> - Disable Smooth Lighting
> - Decrease your Render Distance. (10-12 Recommended)
> - Disable Particles

### • Game Latency is High
> A slowly responding game is a big issue. To resolve this, follow these steps:
> - Disable Particles
> - Make sure there are no "Lag Machines" that could possibly be causing this issue
> - Restart your game to clear caches, items, etc.

## • Shaders:
When playing Expanded Vanilla, you can play with Shaders if you would like but we advise against it. This puts a significant strain on your computer. If your computer can handle it, feel free to run shaders.

### • Issues with Shaders:
> If you are experiencing issues with your shaders, then follow this guide:
> - Make sure your shaders are up-to-date.
> - If you are experiencing visual errors, press R to reload them
> - If your errors continue, we advise you disable your shaders.
